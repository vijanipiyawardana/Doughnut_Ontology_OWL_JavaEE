# Doughnut Ontology

Doughnut is a very popular dessert or a sweet. There are many flavours and variations of doughnuts available today. In this assignment I tried to create an ontology for various types of doughnuts available.

## Data taken from online doughnut selling websites

## Implementation: 

- Ontology was created using Protege as a **OWL ontology**
- SPARQL as the query language
- Implemented a Java Web Project
- Netbeans as IDE
- Apache Tomcat
- JSP Servlets 
- Apache Jena library to access OWL ontology
